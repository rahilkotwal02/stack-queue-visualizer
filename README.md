# 📦 Stack & Queue Visualizer 

An interactive, educational tool for visualizing two fundamental linear data structures: **Stack (LIFO)** and **Queue (FIFO)**.  
Built with vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project demonstrates how these data structures behave through real-time animations and live statistics.

Designed for students who want to strengthen their understanding of stacks and queues through **direct visual interaction**.
